Project Title: Cancer Prediction App

Overview:
Our project is a machine learning-powered cancer prediction application that assists in the early diagnosis of oncological diseases, specifically breast cancer. The app analyzes various characteristics of cell nuclei extracted from breast tissue biopsies to determine the likelihood of malignancy.

How It Works:
The application processes diagnostic measurements of cell nuclei—such as radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, and concavity. These features are then evaluated using a trained machine learning model to predict whether the tissue is benign or malignant.

Data Source:
The app’s predictive model is built using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset, which contains real clinical measurements from digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNAs) of breast masses. This dataset is publicly available and widely used in medical AI research.

Scientific Contribution:
	•	Demonstrates how IT technologies, especially data science and machine learning, can be directly applied to medical diagnostics.
	•	Illustrates cross-disciplinary innovation, integrating biology, statistics, and artificial intelligence.
	•	Encourages early screening, which is a critical step in cancer treatment and survivability.

Impact:
This project exemplifies how Kazakhstan’s priority field—the IT industry—can be leveraged for breakthroughs in healthcare and biomedical research, showing that high school students can meaningfully contribute to science through modern tools and interdisciplinary thinking.
